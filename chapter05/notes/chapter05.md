# Chapter 05 - Monte Carlo Methods

Learning method for estimating value functions and discovering optimal policies

- do not assume complete knowledge of the environment
- require only *experience* (sample sequences of states, actions, rewards from actual/simulated interaction with an environment)
- requires no prior knowledge of the environment's dynamics

Monte Carlo methods are ways of solving RL problem based on averaging sample returns
- experience divided into episodes, all episodes eventually terminate
- methods based on averaging complete returns
